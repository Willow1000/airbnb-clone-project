Overview
This is a backend-focused Airbnb clone built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). The project aims to replicate core Airbnb functionalities such as:

User authentication and profile management

Listing creation, editing, and deletion

Search and filtering of listings

Booking system with date validation

Reviews and ratings

RESTful API endpoints for frontend integration

The goal is to architect a scalable, secure, and maintainable API backend that can power a full-featured booking platform, serving as a solid foundation for frontend expansion or mobile integration.

🚀 Technology Stack
Python 3.11+

Django – Web framework for backend logic and admin tools

Django REST Framework (DRF) – For building RESTful APIs

PostgreSQL – Primary database (optional, fallback to SQLite during dev)

JWT Authentication – For secure token-based login/logout

Docker (optional) – For containerized development

Swagger / DRF-YASG – For interactive API documentation

Team Roles
🧠 Project Manager
Responsible for overall planning, timeline management, and communication. Ensures the project stays on track, aligns with the goals, and meets deadlines.

🛠️ Backend Developer
Designs and implements the server-side logic using Django and Django REST Framework. Handles API endpoints, authentication, business logic, and integration with the database.

🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the data models, relationships, indexing strategies, and database optimization. Ensures data integrity, backups, and performance tuning.

🧪 QA Engineer / Tester
Writes and runs automated/manual tests to ensure API endpoints work correctly and consistently. Also responsible for regression testing and identifying bugs pre-deployment.

🔒 DevOps / Deployment Engineer
Handles environment setup, CI/CD pipelines, Dockerization, and deployment strategies. Ensures smooth version control, staging, and production releases.

📄 Technical Writer
Maintains project documentation including README, API docs (Swagger or DRF-YASG), changelogs, and developer guides to ease onboarding and usage.



🗃️ Database Design
The following are the core entities in the system and their relationships:

🔐 Users
Represents registered users — both guests and hosts.

Important Fields:

id: Primary key (UUID or AutoField)

email: Unique identifier for login

password: Hashed password

is_host: Boolean flag to distinguish hosts from guests

date_joined: Account creation timestamp

Relationships:

A user can create multiple properties (if they’re a host)

A user can book multiple properties (as a guest)

A user can leave multiple reviews

🏠 Properties
Represents a property or listing available for rent.

Important Fields:

id: Primary key

owner: ForeignKey to User

title: Short description of the property

description: Detailed info about the listing

price_per_night: Numeric field for nightly rate

Relationships:

A property is owned by one host (user)

A property can have many bookings and many reviews

📅 Bookings
Represents a reservation of a property by a guest.

Important Fields:

id: Primary key

guest: ForeignKey to User

property: ForeignKey to Property

check_in: Date field

check_out: Date field

Relationships:

A booking is made by one user (guest)

A booking is associated with one property

⭐ Reviews
Represents user-generated feedback for a property.

Important Fields:

id: Primary key

author: ForeignKey to User

property: ForeignKey to Property

rating: Integer (1–5)

comment: Text field

Relationships:

A review is written by one user

A review belongs to one property

💳 Payments
Represents transactions made for bookings.

Important Fields:

id: Primary key

booking: OneToOneField to Booking

amount: Decimal

status: Enum or CharField (pending, completed, failed)

payment_method: e.g., card, PayPal

Relationships:

Each booking has exactly one payment

Payments are tied to users indirectly through bookings

✨ Feature Breakdown
👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can be either guests who book properties or hosts who list them. Includes secure authentication using JWT and role-based access control for managing permissions.

🏠 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details such as title, description, location, price, and availability. This feature is core to enabling a marketplace-like environment for short-term rentals.

📆 Booking System
Guests can book available properties for specific dates. The system ensures date validations, avoids double bookings, and calculates total costs. It also links bookings with payments and user histories.

⭐ Review & Rating System
Users can leave reviews and rate properties they’ve stayed at. This helps maintain trust in the platform and provides social proof for other guests. Reviews include text feedback and a numeric rating from 1 to 5.

💳 Payment Integration
Handles payment processing for confirmed bookings. Payments are linked to bookings and include transaction status (pending, successful, failed). While initially mocked or simplified, this module is designed to integrate with real payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal in the future.

📄 API Documentation
Interactive Swagger documentation is available for all endpoints using DRF-YASG. This allows developers to test and understand API behavior in real time, making integration with frontend or mobile apps seamless.


🔐 API Security
Security is a critical part of this project to protect sensitive user data, prevent abuse, and ensure the integrity of the booking and payment system. Below are the core measures in place to secure the API:

✅ Authentication
The project uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless, secure authentication. Tokens are issued upon login and must be included in headers for all protected routes. This ensures only verified users can access personal or sensitive endpoints.

Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access to user profiles, bookings, and payment info.

🛡️ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced. Hosts can manage properties, guests can make bookings, and only the rightful user can modify their data.

Why it matters: Stops users from accessing or modifying data they don’t own — e.g., booking someone else’s property.

⏱️ Rate Limiting
Basic rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute-force attacks, spamming endpoints, and overwhelming the server. Tools like DRF throttling will be used to control request flow per user/IP.

Why it matters: Helps mitigate abuse, bot traffic, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

🔒 Data Validation & Sanitization
All inputs are validated and sanitized on both backend and API layers using DRF serializers. This prevents injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS) and ensures consistent data handling.

Why it matters: Protects the backend from malicious inputs and improves data quality.

🔐 Secure Payments
All payment endpoints are protected with both authentication and transaction-level validations. Sensitive operations will use HTTPS and CSRF protection (when applicable in browser-based flows).

Why it matters: Prevents fraud, data leaks, and fake transactions that could compromise trust.

🧯 Error Handling & Logging
API errors are sanitized — internal exceptions are not exposed. Logging is implemented for security-related events such as failed logins, permission errors, and payment issues.

Why it matters: Prevents leaking stack traces or system internals to attackers, while keeping an audit trail.
